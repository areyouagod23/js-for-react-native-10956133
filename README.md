# Task 1:
The `processArray` function takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

# Task 2:
The `formatArrayStrings` function takes two arrays, an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number, capitalizing the entire string if the number is even and converting the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

# Task 3:
The `createUserProfiles` function takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2. It returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).

# Task 4:
This README file includes my student ID and a brief explanation of each task.
